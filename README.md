## Matlab_scripts

This directory includes all of the Matlab code used to describe and analyze the systems of differential equations. This includes base models with limited functionality, functions to iterate through a vector of selection coefficients and generate bifurcation data, and numerical ODE scripts. More details are included in the README file for this directory. 

## python_simulations

This directory includes all of the Python scripts used to simulate the discrete, generation-based version of our model. More details are included in the README file for this directory.
